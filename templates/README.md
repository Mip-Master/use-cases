# Would you like to contribute?

The main goal of the Learning MIP project
is to make MIP accessible so anyone can 
take advantage of it. So having a diverse
and extensive library of use cases will help
people to learn more, better understand the
power of the MIP technology, practice, and 
find example of solutions that might help 
them to solve their own problems.

As an author, besides making a contribution,
you practice modeling and coding best practices,
improve communication skills (while explaining
your solution), and gain exposure, as your 
name will be listed in the home page of the
project.

Got an idea of a use case but are not sure
if it's a good one? Let's discuss it!
