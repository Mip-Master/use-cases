# MIP
MIP stands for Mixed-integer Programming, which is a fantastic 
technology for modeling and solving decision-making problem in a 
variety of domains such as supply chain and logistics, scheduling,
electric power generation, and many more.

Here, you will find lots of practical, hands-on examples to 
learn and apply MIP to solve real-world problems. Many years of
industry experience have been combined to develop this material
aiming to help you to adopt the best practices right from the 
beginning.

One of the primary goal of Mip Master is to make the MIP
technology accessible beyond the operations research community,
and especially to the data science community.

With that in mind, the use cases we share are designed to be
as didactic as they can be (without compromising performance)
and all of then are implemented in Python.

Don't know Python? No worries, you will learn along the way.
Don't know optimization? Mip Master got you covered on that too!
