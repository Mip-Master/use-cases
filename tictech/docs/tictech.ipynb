    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Mr. Mip has been contacted by *TicTech*, an organization that is now going through a digital transformation and needs to make an important decision. They need to decide on the right type of technology that will support them making complex decisions as their business grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading a [blog](https://medium.com/opex-analytics/purpose-built-apps-for-enterprise-decision-making-31ccadad362d) about technologies for decision-making, Mr. Mip arrived at three options:\n",
    "1. Consulting services\n",
    "2. Off-the-shelf software\n",
    "3. Purpose-built web applications (Apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing pos and cons of each technology in the context of TicTech, Mr. Mip derived in collaboration with them a score to each technology as follows: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "12-\\text{Consulting}, 17-\\text{Software}, 25-\\text{Apps}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "What technology should be selected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that Mr. Mip he can only recommend one technology and the goal is to maximize the score, it’s obvious that TicTech should pick apps. However, Mr. Mip is a MIP fanatic! And sometimes he uses MIP just for fun. And sometimes just for teaching others how to use this fantastic technology! So, let’s see how he solved this baby problem using MIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Mip always breaks the problem in three major steps:\n",
    "1. *Understanding the business problem*: Identifying all the requirements of the problem, including the data.\n",
    "2. *Mathematical formulation*: Writing a precise mathematical representation of the problem.\n",
    "3. *Model implementation and optimization*: Coding the formulation as an optimization model and using an optimization solver to compute the best solution.\n"

One thing you will notice is that they all look very simmilar, except for some minor variation of syntaxe. And they all look very much like the actual mathematical formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python script of each implementation is available in the Mip Master [repository](https://github.com/mip-master/learning_mip/) on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is very readable, but is a breakdown of the steps:\n",
    "1. Import the package.\n",
    "2. Initialize a model instance and gives it a name.\n",
    "3. Add the three decision variables at once from a list of indices and give it a name.\n",
    "4. Add the only constraint of the model and give it a name.\n",
    "5. Set the objective function.\n",
    "6. Call the optimizer.\n",
    "7. Retrieve and print out the solution.\n",

    "The output is a dictionary that look like this: `{1: 0.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 1.0}`.\n",
