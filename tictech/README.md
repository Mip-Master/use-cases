# TicTech

This is the directory for the TicTech use case.

It you are new to the Learning MIP project, 
you may want to start from its
[homepage](
https://mip-master.github.io/learning_mip/).

For documentation about the TicTech use case, 
including the problem statement and formulation, see 
[tictech.docx](
../tictech/docs/tictech.docx)
or 
[tictech.pdf](
../tictech/docs/tictech.pdf).

## Concepts covered
- The three steps to solve a problem
- The three components of a formulation
- Modeling with binary decision variables
- Calling a MIP solver
