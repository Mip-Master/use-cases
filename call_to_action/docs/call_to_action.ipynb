    "\n",
    "*Author: Rohit Karvekar*  \n",
    "*July, 2021*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the documentation for the *Silly Bean* use case, which is part of the [Learning Mip](https://mip-master.github.io/learning_mip/) project maintained by [Mip Master](https://mipmaster.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Covered\n",
    "* Modeling with continuous decision variables.\n",
    "* Modeling fixed cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Silly Bean, a big retailer company, reached out to *Market Down Analytics* because they wanted to optimally allocate an annual budget of $1$ million dollars into four marketing channels: *Print*, *TV*, *Search Engine Optimization (SEO)*, and *Social Media*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to maximize *return of investment* (ROI) across the four marketing channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it was crucial for the business to make sure that the marketing plan stayed within the budget and met additional business constraints put forward by the marketing team:\n",
    "* At least $40\\%$ of the total budget must go towards conventional channels: Print and TV;\n",
    "* Annual allocation to the Print channel can't be more than $100,000$ dollars;\n",
    "* The marketing strategy says that investment in Social Media should be at most three times the investment on SEO;\n",
    "* The target is to reach at least $1.5$ million customers annually with the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before contacting Market Down Analytics, in preparation for this project, Silly Bean had hired a consulting company for collecting relevant statistical data from their existing and potential customers. The consulting company effectively derived coefficients for the expected ROI and customer penetration associated with each of the four marketing channel. These coefficients are summarized in the next table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Channel | ROI | Penetration|\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| Print | $16$ $\\%$ | $2.1$ |\n",
    "| TV | $9$ $\\%$ | $2.5$ |\n",
    "| SEO | $6$ $\\%$ | $3.0$ |\n",
    "| Social Media | $14$ $\\%$ | $0.9$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Silly Bean decide to invest $100K$ dollars in Print, then they should expect to hit $210K$ viewers and a net profit of $16K$ dollars as consequence of the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we populating each of the session below that compose a complete mathematical formulation of the optimization problem. The solution to this optimization problem will be the amount that Silly Bean should invest in each channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set of indices\n",
    "- $I=\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ Set of marketing channels, where $1, 2, 3, 4$ correspond to Print, TV, SEO, and Social Media, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "* $r_i$ Expected ROI (percentage of invested capital) from channel $i$.\n",
    "* $p_i$ Expected market penetration (number of viewers per dollar invested) with channel $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is readily available from the table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "Since we want to maximize ROI across all the marketing channels, our decision variable is the budget allocated to each of the four marketing channels:\n",
    "* $x_i$\budget to be allocated to channel $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Maximum total budget available is $1$ million dollars*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 \\leq 1,000,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Print and TV to account for at least $40\\%$ of the total budget*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1+x_2 \\geq 0.4 * 1,000,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Print's budget can't exceed $100K$*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1 \\leq 100,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* *The investment on Social Media should be at most three times the investment on SEO*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_4 \\leq 3 * x_3.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Reach minimum viewers target (1.5 million)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_1x_1+p_2x_2+p_3x_3+p_4x_4 \\geq 1,500,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal is to maximize total ROI across all the marketing channels:\n",
    "$$\\max{r_1x_1 + r_2x_2 + r_3x_3 + r_4x_4}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Formulation\n",
    "Putting everything together, we obtain the following linear program.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&\\max &\\sum_ir_ix_i \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{s.t.} &\\sum_ix_i &\\leq 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "&&\\ x_1+x_2 &\\geq 0.4 * 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "&&\\ x_1 &\\leq 100,000\\\\\n",
    "&&\\ x_4 &\\leq 3 * x_3\\\\\n",
    "&&\\ \\sum_ip_ix_i &\\geq 1,500,000\\\\\n",
    "&&\\ x_i &\\geq 0,\\quad \\forall i.\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation & Optimization\n",
    "The implementation of the optimization model is available in the Mip Master [repository](https://github.com/mip-master/learning_mip/blob/develop/silly_bean/scripts) on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Yourself\n",
    "Silly Bean also had data showing that Podcast would yield a good ROI of $21\\%$ and customer penetration of $0.8$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why they didn't want to include Podcast as one of the channels alternative was because it requires a kickoff investment, estimated in $50K$ dollars (this initial investment is required to buy equipments and set up a team to run the podcast). \n",
    "\n",
    "After some discussions, Market Down Analytics convinced Silly Bean's stakeholders to add Podcast to the list. However, Market Down Analytics must account for the fact that, if Silly Bean was to invest in Podcast, then they would have to draft the additional $50K$ dollars from the total budget, but that $50K$ does not count towards ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you modify the model above to include Podcast and account for the upfront cost of $50K$?"
